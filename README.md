## Notes relating to my church internal refurbishment ideas.

### Background:

We visit our local church, consecrated in 1861, occasionally through the year to participate in Sunday services during which our children walk in the uniformed flag parades.  We sing songs, feel as though our presence enhances our community in a small way and, of course, we contribute tiny amounts to the church funds.


The church now has budget approval to refurbish the roof and bell tower but today we were asked for our suggestions for internal works, so the ideas can be collated later; this being the very start of a consultation process.

### So what observations did we make whilst still in the church?

* The pews have a layer of tapestry/carpet between bench and bum.  A lady behind us suggested **comfy cushions.**
* Quite naturally the topic then  turned to **the lack of pumps and optics along the wall behind where the teas and biscuits are served** at the end of each service.  Maybe one for a more progressive organisation to implement though?
* The **breaks in the front face of the raised stone floor between the altar and the main body of the church** have been patched over the years.  Not exactly inspirational, unless there's a message thereâ€¦
* The **screen between the pulpit and the organ** is plain, featureless.
* The **step-stool behind the pulpit,** provisioned for vertically-challenged folks to stand on, is a bit grotty, a plywood box sandwiching tired carpet.

Yes, we usually sit really close to the front.

### After lunch I asked my girls for their ideas:

* My oldest suggested **more flowers would enhance the church's appeal** for her.  I should omit her wish for shorter services from the final version of this document.
* **My youngest suggested **an upgrade to the children's play area,** and rejected the idea of a separate room.

### Bonus observations:

* **The steps up from the main road need a better sign** at the top and bottom to indicate the mild peril inherent in their use in inclement weather **and, perhaps, non-slip edges laying down.**
